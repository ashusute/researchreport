Market Analysis and Insights

Thermoset Composites Market

Increasing demand for a range of lightweight materials by the end user industries has led to the rise in demand for thermoset composites. Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the thermoset composites market will witness a CAGR of 6.335% for the forecast period of 2021-2028. This when converted in terms of market value, it will rise up to USD 91.37 billion by the year 2028.

Thermoset composites are the polymers that are made with thermoset matrices having great strength and low impact-toughness making. The thermoset composites don’t witness chemical instability as they are composed of thermoplastic matrix. These are based on glass, carbon and aramid fibres. The thermoset composites can be remoulded without degradation on heating and on cooling they solidify into a finished shape.

There is a substantial rise in the demand for thermoset composites by the various end user industries owing to it beneficial properties such as strength, rigidity and high temperature resistance. Due to the rapid growth and expansion of aerospace industry, the demand for thermoset composites has multiplied over the years. Increased investment coupled with increased research and development proficiencies in wind energy sector will further fuel up the demand for thermoset composites.

However, high cost of thermoset composites will pose as a big obstruction in the way of market growth. Also, high cost involved in research and development proficiencies will not work in the favour of the market in the long run. Non-recyclable and non-reusability properties of thermoset composites will further pose a challenge for the growth of market.
